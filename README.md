# Pidoku

An in-progress web-based sudoku game. Currently single-player, but will have user account, multi-player, etc. soon!

## Development

API calls from the frontend are proxied to a backend running on port `3001`. Start your backend server on that port before running the Vite dev server so that requests to `/api` are forwarded correctly.
